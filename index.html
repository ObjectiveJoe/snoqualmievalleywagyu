<p> We specialize in raising free range grass feed Wagyu beef on our organically managed farm.
    We believe in running a small closed herd operation, where each cow is born and bred here at our farm.
    We personally walk out and talk to our cows, and provide personal care and attention to each one.
    We ensure humane slaughter with our partners <a href="https://delfoxmeats.com/">Del Fox Meats</a>
