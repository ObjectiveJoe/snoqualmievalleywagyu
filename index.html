<h1>Snoqualmie Valley Wagyu - raising delicious beef the old fashioned way</h1>

<p>Snoqualmie Valley Wagyu is raised on the wide fertile valley grasses of the Snoqualmie Valley.
    We are hosted by Joseph and Diana Hayes at Broad Acres Farm.
</p>
<p> We specialize in raising free range grass feed Wagyu beef on our organically managed farm.
    We believe in running a small closed herd operation, where each cow is born and bred here at our farm.
    We personally walk out and talk to our cows, and provide personal care and attention to each one.
    We ensure humane slaughter with our partners <a href="https://delfoxmeats.com/">Del Fox Meats</a>
</p>
<p>
    We raise a limited number of these super fine grass feed Wagyu cattle. 
    We require 20% down to reserve a share for you. Shares can be an entire beef (~700-750  lbs), 
    a side of beef (~350 lbs), or a quarter of beef (~150-175 lbs). 
    We will provide you with the exact weights once it is hanging at Del Fox Meats, and require full payment within 7 days.
    Forms of payment incude cash, checks and Venmo.
</p>
<p>Our current prices for 2024 is just $4/lb hanging weight plus you have to pay the butcher fees which run ~$1.25 / lb</p>
